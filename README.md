Project Structure:

Branching Policy:
- Create new feature branches, push them to integration, then make a request to push to main (and have a buddy approve request if all looks good)

Commit Policy: 
- NO pushing .config folders or files unless needed
- NO git add *
- NO code or document uploads directly on GitHub. Every commit needs to go through
git on the terminal.
- NO pushing off merge conflicts to your teammate when you try to push. If you get
a conflict when you push, it is on you to fix it.
- NO directly pushing to main until demo days. You will have to merge integration
to main only on those days.
- NO committing syntactically incorrect code into branches. Everuthing you commit
should work. You should have tested it.
- NO turning on git on VSCode.
- Don't commit .env files
- DONT commit .csv files 
- IF you arent sure dont commmit
